# Sapient AI Project

---

Do you ever wake up thinking: boy do you know what I need more of in my life? AI's with the capability to become self aware.
Well I did.

To put all jokes aside one of the most interesting questions in AI is how we could make an AI that can learn, think, and 
act like a human. To this day we are still strugling with this question and to be honest I think we have been going about this wrong.
